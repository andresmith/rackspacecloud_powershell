This is a work in progress Powershell 3.0 module for an API client against Rackspace Cloud Servers and eventually openstack.  The first working iteration should be completed by 3/22/2013.

***THIS IS NOT CURRENTLY INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE***

This is not a Rackspace sponsored project. I am a Solutions Engineer with Rackspace and am writing this script as a personal project and eventual contribution into Openstack.
